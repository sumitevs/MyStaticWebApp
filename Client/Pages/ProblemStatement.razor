        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <br />
        Let us start by understanding what problem we want to solve. Any skill or knowledge should be used to solve a problem. 
        Therefore, on our journey to acquire programming skills, the very first step should rightly be to understand the problem so that we can work towards a solution for it.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will keep it as simple as possible with a super familiar scenario.
        <br />
        <br />
        <mark> You are going to start a restaurant. You need a software that can take in orders from a customer. It should then calulate the bill for the customer.</mark>
        <br />
        <br />
        Yes, this is a vague requirement that can be broken down into a lot of details. However, let us keep it simple for now. We will start with just one customer placing an order for food and receiving the bill for their order.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will find a solution for this problem first in a simple console application. 
        The basic black screen may not be so exciting, but it is a good start. 
        Once we have that out of the way, we can advance to a WPF application that can run on a desktop, using the same underlying code as our console app. Then we can explore how we can make this a web application using Blazor. 
        Finally, we will see how to create a mobile app using MAUI.
        <br />
        <br />
        We just ran through a lot of .NET dreams, but let us make them happen.
