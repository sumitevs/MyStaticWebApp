        “Hello World!”
        These words are synonymous to the very first steps to any programming language. 
        <br />
        <br />

        So let's start a “hello world!” journey. Trying to understand simple programming and solution thinking.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am a dot net developer. Not an expert, a learner. 
        And whatever I learn, I love to teach. I try to simplify. 
        I believe any complex topic if broken down and simplified well enough, it no more remains to be a complex topic.
